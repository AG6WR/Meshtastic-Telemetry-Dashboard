# This file contains the new 3-row card layout
# To be inserted starting after: "stale_color = self.colors['fg_secondary']  # Grey for stale data"

I'm creating this as a planning document because the replacement is too large for a single operation.

ROW 1 DESIGN: Battery Information
- Left half: "ICP Batt: 12.9V (80%), +2.5A (charging)"
  - Show Ch3 Voltage with percentage
  - Show Ch3 Current with charging/discharging indicator
- Right half: "Node Batt: 4.2V (100%)"
  - Show Internal Battery Voltage with percentage

ROW 2 DESIGN: Network/System Metrics
- Column 1: SNR (with colored bars, preserved from current)
- Column 2: Air Util TX
- Column 3: Ch Util

ROW 3 DESIGN: Environmental Conditions
- Column 1: Temperature  
- Column 2: Humidity
- Column 3: Pressure

Card Width: 460px (was 380px)
Row widths need to be divided appropriately for readability
